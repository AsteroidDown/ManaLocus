          If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable, the
          remaining Terms shall remain in full force and effect, and the
          unenforceable provision shall be replaced by an enforceable provision
          that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable
          provision.

          No waiver by us of any term or condition set forth in these Terms
          shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or
          condition or a waiver of any other term or condition. Our failure to
          insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these
          Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any right.
